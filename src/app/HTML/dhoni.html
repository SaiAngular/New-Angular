                    <strong>Jersery Number 07 </strong>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and
                        Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[39]
                        Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an
                        opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL
                        move to the A division.[40] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection
                        in the Bihar team.[41]<em> Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and
                            eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.[42][43]</em>

                    </p>
                    <p> , Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings). However,
                        Bihar finished<strong> fourth in the group of six and did not make</strong> it to the
                        quarter-finals.
                        <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"> Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad
                            (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad
                            Trophy).</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He
                        made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket
                        team.[51]
                    </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p><small> Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji
                            Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining
                            recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. </small>
